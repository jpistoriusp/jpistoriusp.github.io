Things learned from Java the Hard Way:

When would you use '=' vs '==' vs '.equals'?
- '=' is used to assign a variable a value. The value will be stored until it is changed later in the program. 
  Ex. "int x = 3" stores the value 3 into the variable x.
- '==' is a relational operator that checks if two values are equal to each other. The result is a true or false value.
  '==' will correctly compare integers and doubles, but will not compare strings.
- '.equals' is a method that compares two strings and result in a true or false value. 
  Ex. "dog.equals("Franklin")" will check if the string dog is equal to "Franklin".
