      <h3>Things learned from <i>Java the Hard Way</i></h3>
         
         <h5>When would you use '=' vs '==' vs '.equals'?</h5>
         <p>'=' is used to assign a variable a value. The value will be stored until it is changed later in the program. 
         Ex. "int x = 3" stores the value 3 into the variable x.
         '==' is a relational operator that checks if two values are equal to each other. The result is a true or false value.
         '==' will correctly compare integers and doubles, but will not compare strings.
         '.equals' is a method that compares two strings and result in a true or false value. 
         Ex. "dog.equals("Franklin")" will check if the string dog is equal to "Franklin".</p>

         <h5>What does it mean to 'cast a double to an int'?</h5>
         <p>Casting a double to an int means you are taking the extra decimals on a double and truncating them. The same thing as rounding
         down a double to a whole number. This could be useful if you wanted to numericaly display a random day of the week. 
         After using 1 + (7*Math.random()) do randomize a number 1-7, the result would be a double, due to the output of Math.random().
         Since there are no decimal days, you would want to reformat the code to 1+(int)(7*Math.random()) to display a single integer value.</p>

         <h5>What is the the difference between a 'for', 'while' and 'do while' loop?</h5>
         <p>A 'for' loop is best used when you specifically know how many times a loop should run. A 'while' and 'do while' loop will 
         always execute the loop body as long as a specified condition is met. The difference between a 'while' and 'do while' loop is
         that a 'while' loop declares its condition prior to the loop body and therefore only runs the body is the condition is met.
         A 'do while' loop features its condition after the loop body and therefore will always run the loop body once before checking
         to see if the condition is met. For example if the condition depends on user input from the loop body, the loop would would need
         to run first. Thus requiring a 'do while' loop and not a 'while' loop.</p>

        <h5>What happens when you include 'import java.util.Scanner;' in your code?</h5>
        <p>The command 'import java.util.Scanner' imports the Scanner library which allows the user to input information to the program
        using their keyboard, files on their computer, or the internet. 'Scanner' is a predefined class inside of the 'util' or 'utilites'
        folder inside of the 'java' folder. So 'Java.util.Scanner' points java to the correct directory to find the Scanner library.</p>

        <h5>What is void in method declaration and how does it differ from declaring a method with a return type?</h5>
        <p>Void should be used in a function when you have no intentions of returning a value. If the function will be called then void
        should be replaced with the type of value that function is returning whether it be int, string, or double.</p>
